# Stock Dashboard (WIP)
This program is a stock dashboard that helps you get real-time information about different stocks. You can enter the stock symbol that you're interested in, and the dashboard will gather a variety of information about that stock. This information includes the closing prices, earning dates, market cap, 3-month treasury rate, and S&P 500 closing price.

All of this data is then compiled into a CSV file that you can download and access later. This way, you can easily keep track of all the different stocks that you're interested in, and you can quickly and easily access all the important information that you need to make informed investment decisions. Overall, this program is a great tool for anyone who wants to stay on top of the latest stock market trends and make smart investment choices.
