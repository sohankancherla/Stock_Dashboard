# Stock Dashboard (WIP)
This program is a stock dashboard that helps you get real-time information about different stocks. You can enter the stock symbol that you're interested in, and the dashboard will gather a variety of information about that stock. This information includes the closing prices, earning dates, market cap, 3-month treasury rate, and S&P 500 closing price. All of this data is then compiled into a CSV file that you can download and access later.

# How to run
